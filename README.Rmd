## Introduction

The goal of strapgod is to create _virtual groups_ on top of a `tibble` or `grouped_df` as a way of resampling the original data frame. You can then efficiently perform various dplyr operations on this `resampled_df`, like: `summarise()`, `do()`, `group_map()`, and more, to easily compute bootstrapped and resampled statistics.

## Installation

You can install the released version of strapgod from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("strapgod")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("DavisVaughan/strapgod")
```

## Learning about strapgod

If you aren't already on the [pkgdown site](https://davisvaughan.github.io/strapgod/), I would encourage starting there. From there, you will be able to click on these two vignettes to learn about working with resampled tibbles.

- `vignette("virtual-bootstraps", "strapgod")`

- `vignette("dplyr-support", "strapgod")`

## Example

Create resampled data frames with `bootstrapify()` or `samplify()`. Notice how we grouped by the _virtual_ column, `.bootstrap` and there are still only 150 rows even though we bootstrapped this dataset 10 times.

```{r first-strap, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(strapgod)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(123)

bootstrapify(iris, 10)
```

You can feed a `resampled_df` into `summarise()` or `group_modify()` to perform
efficient bootstrapped computations.

```{r summarise}
iris %>%
  bootstrapify(10) %>%
  summarise(per_strap_mean = mean(Petal.Width))
```

The original data can be grouped as well, and the bootstraps will be created for each group.

```{r summarise-by-group}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  bootstrapify(10) %>%
  summarise(per_strap_per_species_mean = mean(Petal.Width))
```

## Plotting bootstrapped results

A fun example of using strapgod is to create bootstrapped visualizations quickly and easily for hypothetical outcome plots. 

```{r non-bootstrap-plots, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(ggplot2)

# without bootstrap
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  ylim(y = c(0, 40))
```

```{r bootstrap-plots, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# with bootstrap
mtcars %>%
  bootstrapify(10) %>%
  collect() %>%
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg, group = .bootstrap)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  ylim(y = c(0, 40))
```

## In the wild

- Claus Wilke has used strapgod to power some pieces of his [ungeviz](https://github.com/wilkelab/ungeviz) package for visualizing uncertainty.

- You can watch Claus's [rstudio::conf 2019](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/visualizing-uncertainty-with-hypothetical-outcomes-plots) talk to see ungeviz and strapgod in action.
